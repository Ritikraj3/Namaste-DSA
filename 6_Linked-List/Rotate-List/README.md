Let’s break it down visually.

We’ll use an example list:

```
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
k = 2
```

---

## **Approach 1: Two-pointer method**

**Step 1:** Find length = 5, optimize `k` → `k = 2`

**Step 2:** Move `fast` pointer `k` steps ahead

```
s: 1      f: 3
```

List is still:

```
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
```

**Step 3:** Move both pointers until `fast.next = null`

```
s: 3      f: 5
```

**Step 4:** Break and reattach

```
Before:   1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
                      ↑
                      s
After:    4 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 3
```

---

## **Approach 2: Circular list method**

**Step 1:** Find length = 5, tail = node `5`

**Step 2:** Make it circular:

```
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
      ↑         ↓
      ← ← ← ← ←
```

**Step 3:** Find break position = `length - k - 1` = `5 - 2 - 1` = 2
Move 2 steps from head:

```
newCurr: 3
```

**Step 4:** Break the circle at `newCurr`

```
4 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 3   ❌ (wrong direction — let's shift head)
newHead = 4
final:  4 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 3
```

---

📌 **Key Takeaway:**

* Approach 1: Walk with two pointers until split point.
* Approach 2: Loop once, connect to head, then break at a fixed index.

If you want, I can also make you a **color-coded animated diagram** showing the actual pointer movement frame-by-frame so it’s *super* easy to remember. That would make it click instantly.
