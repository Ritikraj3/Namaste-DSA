Got it 👍
Here’s a **proper README draft** introducing **Binary Trees**. I’ll keep it clear, structured, and beginner-friendly with examples, diagrams (ASCII), and relatable badges/icons.

## 📌 What is a Binary Tree?

A **Binary Tree** is a data structure where each node has at most **two children**:

* **Left child** 🌿
* **Right child** 🍂

It’s called *binary* because of this **two-child restriction**.

---

## 🖼️ Visual Example

Here’s a simple binary tree:

```
       1   ← Root
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   4   5
```

* `1` is the **root node**.
* `2` and `3` are **children** of `1`.
* `4` and `5` are **children** of `2`.
* Nodes without children (like `4, 5, 3`) are called **leaf nodes**.

---

## ⚙️ Key Terms

* **Root** → The top node (like `1` above).
* **Parent** → A node that has children (e.g., `2` is parent of `4` and `5`).
* **Child** → Nodes under a parent (e.g., `4` is child of `2`).
* **Leaf** → Node with no children.
* **Height** → Longest path from root to a leaf.

---

## 🧭 Types of Binary Trees

1. **Full Binary Tree** → Every node has 0 or 2 children.
2. **Complete Binary Tree** → All levels are filled except possibly the last.
3. **Perfect Binary Tree** → All internal nodes have 2 children + all leaves are at same level.
4. **Balanced Binary Tree** → Height difference between left and right subtrees is minimal (e.g., AVL tree).

## 🔀 Tree Traversals

Traversal = visiting nodes in a certain order.

1. **Preorder (Root → Left → Right)**
   Example for tree above: `1, 2, 4, 5, 3`

2. **Inorder (Left → Root → Right)**
   Example: `4, 2, 5, 1, 3`

3. **Postorder (Left → Right → Root)**
   Example: `4, 5, 2, 3, 1`

4. **Level Order (Breadth-First)**
   Example: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

---

## 💻 Sample Code (JavaScript)

```js
class Node {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val
    this.left = null
    this.right = null
  }
}

// Example: build tree
let root = new Node(1)
root.left = new Node(2)
root.right = new Node(3)
root.left.left = new Node(4)
root.left.right = new Node(5)

// Postorder Traversal
function postorder(node, ans = []) {
  if (!node) return ans
  postorder(node.left, ans)
  postorder(node.right, ans)
  ans.push(node.val)
  return ans
}

console.log(postorder(root)) // [4, 5, 2, 3, 1]
```

## 🎯 Why Learn Binary Trees?

* Used in **searching & sorting algorithms**.
* Base for **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**, **Heaps**, **AVL Trees**, **Red-Black Trees**.
* Real-world use in **databases, file systems, compilers, and networking**.
