# 🚀 Namaste-DSA

Welcome to my **Namaste-DSA** repository! This is a personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems and their solutions that I'm solving while learning and growing as a developer. My goal is to strengthen core DSA concepts and become interview-ready by practicing consistently.

## 📚 My DSA Journey

I began this journey to master DSA not just for interviews but to build a strong foundation in problem-solving. I learn using **visualizations, videos, hands-on coding**, and practice mostly with **JavaScript**. My focus is on **writing clean, readable code** and **organizing** everything well.

This repo reflects my **consistency and dedication** — I’ll keep adding new topics and optimizing solutions regularly. 💪
